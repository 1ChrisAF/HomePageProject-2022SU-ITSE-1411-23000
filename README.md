# HomePageProject-2022SU-ITSE-1411-23000
First project for Beginning Web Programming at Dallas College, under Professor Herd. 

Repo was private until complete. Access to the page on the school server is unrestricted, so there's no real use keeping the repo private for academic integrity purposes. Anyone could copy my work regardless of this repo's visibility, though that would still be a bad idea.

If this needs to change, I'd be happy to do so.
